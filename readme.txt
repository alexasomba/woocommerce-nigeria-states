A short plugin that adds Nigeria postal states to WooCommerce's list of states.



== Description ==

This is a Nigerian State/County plugin for Woocommerce. It adds Nigeria postal states to WooCommerce's list of states.

Woocommerce as at the time of development of this plugin lacks the State/Counties of some Countries including Nigeria and that causes the Error "State/County" required during registration of Address for users. This  plugin takes care of adding the list of states in a drop-down menu format and making it accessible for woocomerce users with Nigerian addresses.
